(1) by profits alone, Action is the most profitable genres. 
(2) on average, Adventure is the most profitable genre, then sci-fi and animation.

    the same pattern was observed for their profits => this is a strong indicator that it is not because 
    these genres generally attract more people, it just because they are released more.
